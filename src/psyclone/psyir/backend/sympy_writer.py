        `MOD(a, b)`. We must therefore make sure that a member
        access is unique (e.g. `b` could already be a scalar variable).
        This is done by creating a new name, which replaces the `%`
        with an `_`. So `a%b` becomes `MOD(a, a_b)`. This makes it easier
        to see where the function names come from.
        Additionally, we still need to avoid a name clash, e.g. there
        could already be a variable `a_b`. This is done by using a symbol
        table, which was prefilled with all references (`a` in the example
        above) in the constructor. We use the string containing the '%' as
        a unique tag and get a new, unique symbol from the symbol table
        based on the new name using `_`. For example, the access to member
        `b` in `a(i)%b` would result in a new symbol with tag `a%b` and a
